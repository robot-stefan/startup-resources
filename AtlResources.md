Various events that I have attended. 

Notes on ways to save on parking. If it is walkable from a MARTA station are included. 

### Event Calendars - Regular
- [Georgia World Congress Center (GWCC)](https://www.gwcca.org/events) - ATL is a focus city for many trade shows. With those comes various networking events. Getting to the GWCC is very easy and low cost on MARTA. If you search social media for tradeshow booths typically you can find a promo code from companies with larger booths and get on the tradeshow floor for under $150. Shows typically move around cities each year, but the GWCC is one of the larger and more prominent venues in the US. You might be able to network with possible customers, sales channels, and undercover some high level understandings without traveling too far and spending funds. 
- [StartUp Village](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/atlanta-startup-village-tickets-224756281087) - Pitches from a variety of ATL startups with good networking from others inthe ecosystem. Most of what I have seen is software focused products at these.

### Hardware
Atlanta is one of the few nodes with supply warehouses, machine shops, vendors, distribution, electronics assembly, and major logistics nodes collocated with one another. A number of these can be found along Fulton Industrial and Peachtree Industrial corridors. Two other clusters which are somewhat smaller can be found around the ATL airport and Dobbins Air Base.
