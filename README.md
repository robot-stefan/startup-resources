# Startup Resources
I have spent a while in various startups both as engineering contributor, an outside consultant, and as cofounder. I have been through startup accelerators[^accelerators] and raised funding through SBIR grants in the past. Deployed hardware onsite at customers in manufacturing environments (notably the 777X wing box) and have developed multiple ground and aerial unmanned / uncrewed systems over the years. Before industry I spent some time in college fighting for funding and running an award winning  robotics competition team and STEM outreach program[^compteam] impacting 80+ high schools throughout the south east united states[^kickoff]. Preceding college I was part of a webhosting start up in high school[^webhost]. The goal of this repo is to act as a knowledge and resource dump for hardtech and as well as for those in ATL. As wells as cominbe info from two linktrees[^linktrees] in to one location with additional context.
